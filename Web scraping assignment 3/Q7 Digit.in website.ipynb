These machines usually carry the best hardware, and in our case, we get a machine that\\'s powered by the the pariing of an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 with 16GB VRAM. Our testing concludes that gaming on this machine is in every way a total treat, but there are a few caveats. For starters, no game currently leverages the 16GB VRAM on the RTX 3080. Second, while the display is definitely great from a gaming perspective, it lacks colour accuracy and proper colour management. Given its wide-gamut nature, there is no way to lock it into sRGB mode, making colour treatment difficult.\\nREAD FULL REVIEW\\nASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 Prices in India\\nMerchant Name\\nAvailablity\\nPrice\\nGo to Store\\nAVAILABLE\\n₹ 215,990\\nBUY NOW\\nASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 in pictures\\nView All\\nBuild And Design (1)\\nVideos (1)\\nASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 Full Specifications\\nBasic Information\\nModel Name : ASUS\\nLaunch Date (Global) : 28-04-2021\\nOperating System (With Version) : Windows 10 Home\\nDisplay\\nResolution : 1920 x 1080\\nDisplay Size (In Inches) : 15.6\\nMemory\\nRam Included (In Gb) : 16 GB\\nRam Type : DDR4\\nPhysical Specifications\\nLaptop Weight (In Kgs) : 2.30\\nLaptop Dimension (In Mm) : 35.4 x 25.9 x 2.26\\nProcessor\\nProcessor Model Name : AMD Ryzen™ 9 5900HX\\nClock Speed : 3.3 GHz\\nGraphics Processor : NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3070\\nCache L3 : 16M\\nBoost Clock Speed : 4.6 GHz\\nStorage\\nStorage Drive Type : SSD\\nStorage Drive Capacity : 1 TB\\nPower\\nBattery Type : Li-ion\\nPower Supply : 240W\\nSound\\nSpeakers : Yes\\nGaming Laptop Deals : Powerful gaming setups for brilliant wins.\\nGet ₹5,000 Instant Discount on Payment Through Net Banking and Get Alienware AW310H headset worth ₹7,999 at ₹499\\nClick here to know more\\nAdvertisements\\nASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 Brief Description\\nASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 Price in India updated on 8th Jul 2021\\nASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 Price In India Starts From Rs.215990 The best price of ASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 is Rs.215990 on Flipkart.\\nStore\\nProduct Name\\nPrice\\nFlipkart\\nASUS ROG Strix Scar 15\\n₹ 215,990\\nDigit Desk\\nEmail Digit Desk\\nFollow Us\\nAbout Me: Digit Desk authored articles are a collaborative effort of multiple authors contributing to the page.

It still does not defy physics, and as such, does have trouble dissipating heat due to the limited surface area. We don\\'t note any throttling of the Ryzen 9 4900HS, but do note unacceptably high temperatures on the surface of the keyboard. The Anime Matrix display on the G14 is also quite an eye-catcher and a gimmick, but unlike most others, this gimmick has been implemented really well. Overall, for the money, you could buy laptops that deliver far better performance, but with the Zephyrus G14, you\\'re paying for a good amount power packed into a very compact form-factor.\\nREAD FULL REVIEW\\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 Prices in India\\nMerchant Name\\nAvailablity\\nPrice\\nGo to Store\\nOUT OF STOCK\\n₹ 144,990\\nBUY NOW\\nAVAILABLE\\n₹ 164,990\\nBUY NOW\\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 in pictures\\nView All\\nBuild And Design (1)\\nVideos (1)\\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 Full Specifications\\nBasic Information\\nModel Name : ROG Zephyrus G14\\nLaunch Date (Global) : 12-08-2020\\nOperating System (With Version) : Windows 10 Home\\nLaptop Type : Gaming\\nDisplay\\nResolution : 1920 x 1080\\nDisplay Size (In Inches) : 14\\nConnectivity\\nWireless Connectivity : Yes\\nMemory\\nRam Included (In Gb) : 16 GB\\nRam Type : DDR4\\nPhysical Specifications\\nLaptop Weight (In Kgs) : 1.65\\nLaptop Dimension (In Mm) : 32.5 x 22.1 x 1.8\\nProcessor\\nProcessor Model Name : AMD 3rd Gen Ryzen 9\\nClock Speed : 3.3 GHz\\nCores : Quad Core\\nGraphics Processor : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060\\nCache L3 : 8 MB\\nStorage\\nStorage Drive Type : SSD\\nStorage Drive Capacity : 1 TB\\nPower\\nBattery Backup (In Hours) : 4 Hours\\nBattery Type : Lithium\\nPower Supply : 180W\\nGaming Laptop Deals : Powerful gaming setups for brilliant wins.\\nGet ₹5,000 Instant Discount on Payment Through Net Banking and Get Alienware AW310H headset worth ₹7,999 at ₹499\\nClick here to know more\\nAdvertisements\\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 Brief Description\\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 Price in India updated on 17th Feb 2022\\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 Laptops Price In India Starts From Rs. 144990 The best price of Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is Rs. 144990 on Croma, which is 14% less than the cost of Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 on Amazon Rs.164990.\\nStore\\nProduct Name\\nPrice\\nCroma\\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (GA401QE-K2165TS) Ryzen 9 Windows 10 Home Gaming Laptop (16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, NV...\\n₹ 144,990\\nAmazon\\nASUS - ROG Zephyrus G14 14\" Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 9 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 - 1T...\\n₹ 164,990\\nDigit Desk\\nEmail Digit Desk\\nFollow Us\\nAbout Me: Digit Desk authored articles are a collaborative effort of multiple authors contributing to the page.

Most people buying this product will have done their research and know the advantages of this super powerful laptop ! But it still has some problems you should be aware of BEWARE before you buy : - Terrible Keyboard Backlight - Terrible fan noise by default. The laptop has a large fan noise even when idle. It can be solved with some third party fan software, but it doesn\\'t always work. If you are irritated by noise, this laptop is not for you. - no free copy of assassin\\'s Creed Valhalla. This is disappointing because most stores that sell the G14 offer a free copy - no thunderbolt 3 Amazon has also increased the price by 10% since I last bought it a few weeks ago. Consider the price, and whether it\\'s worth it for you. The price will likely go higher than it is now.\\nGerman Panimboza on Amazon.in | 01-01-1970\\nEl equipo llegó a tiempo, es el producto que esperaba, ya estoy trabajando con el mismo.\\nExcellent product with few issues\\njasdeep on Amazon.in | 01-01-1970\\nFew issues: 1. Hot Vents towards the screen. 2. RAM not upgradable to 32gb. 3. All USBpowerEthernet connector ports could have been on one side. Preferably left. Leaves good space for mouse on right. Rest it’s the best config. Great job.\\nChrisio Gwaan on Amazon.in | 01-01-1970\\nIt is a reliable store that you may be able to purchase it. This laptop has a formidable performance with AMD Ryzen 9 CPU, NVIDIA Geforce 2060 Max Q, Ram 16GB, 1T SSD, 1080p+120Hz display. I live in Australia now and tried to find this model of G14 before. Apparently, there is no this kind of the best model of G14 laptop in Australia. So I choose to buy it from Amazon US. If you are a office worker or student, this laptop is quite suitable to study, work and gaming since the design doesn\\'t look like gaming laptop I think. Full of sense of technology.\\nMike Skyriotis on Amazon.in | 01-01-1970\\nI switched from a MacBook to Windows, and I I’m very impressed with the G14 gaming laptop. For its price it’s definitely worth it, worth nothing it has the Ryzen 9, which is awesome. Very smooth and fast performance. I highly recommend this laptop as this is the best value you can get!\\nClick here for more Reviews',\n",
